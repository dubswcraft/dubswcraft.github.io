This month seen a return to the evening open space format where a number of lightening talks kick off the night following by an 'unconference' style evening where people decide and vote on the night what they want to discuss.

The lightening talks commenced with Duncan Jones giving a show and tell of a CQRS Dsl/designer that he is working on. It's a library that allows you to graphically design domain models consisting of aggregate identifiers, events, projects, commands, queries and identity groups with the resulting model then turned into code. Very interesting discussion on a very intersting topic/design pattern. 



More details here:

Next up, Paul gave a talk about revisiting the SOLID principles with functional programming. The talk centered around whether the SOLID principles prevalent in object oriented progamming hold much ground in functional programming.
