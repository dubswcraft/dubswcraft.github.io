Software Craftsmanship is described best by the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto (http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org): This is a community for those who care and are proud of what they do. For those developers, regardless how experienced they are, who want to improve and master their craft. This is a community for those who believe that being average is just not good enough. 

The Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value: Not only working software, but also well-crafted software Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable. 

We welcome developers, business analysts, project managers at any level who are interested in improving their skills via discussing interesting topics, challenging themselves with hands-on sessions, learning Test Driven Development, practicing katas, peeking into new technologies, languages and meeting with software professionals and thinkers who enjoy developing software and care about what they do.
